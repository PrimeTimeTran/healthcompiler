        <strong>San Francisco, Feb 5</strong> – Health Compiler and Hint Health have announced a strategic collaboration aimed at empowering Direct Primary Care (DPC) practices with advanced analytics to strengthen employer partnerships and optimize patient care. This partnership enables Hint customers to leverage Health Compiler's data analytics platform, designed specifically to measure DPC performance, track utilization, and analyze cost savings.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-12 mb-4">Transforming Care Delivery Through Data & Technology</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-6">
        Health Compiler's <a href="/solutions/direct-primary-care" className="text-primary hover:underline font-medium">HC Insights platform</a> seamlessly integrates with key systems used by direct care providers, including Elation, Spruce, Akute, Cerbo, and Hint's suite of products. With deep expertise in health interoperability and data integration, the Health Compiler team ensures compatibility with nearly any healthcare software solution.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        The platform delivers actionable insights through comprehensive reports that measure patient engagement across all direct primary care touchpoints, both in-person and virtual. It monitors preventive health screening compliance and ensures care loops close efficiently by analyzing utilization gaps based on individualized patient health scores. The system provides detailed visibility into specialty care coordination negotiated for members and examines communication patterns including daily conversation frequency, touch rates, and peak engagement times. By leveraging claims data, it clearly demonstrates DPC value compared to non-DPC populations. Additional features include automated sentiment surveys and targeted marketing analytics designed to grow DPC practices.
