        Health Compiler is proud to announce its participation as both, a sponsor and exhibitor in the 2025 Direct Primary Care Summit, happening July 24–27 in New Orleans, LA. As one of the leading gatherings in the primary care ecosystem, the DPC Summit 2025 is where innovators, physicians, employers, and thought leaders converge to shape the future of healthcare. And this year's agenda makes one thing clear: the DPC movement isn't just growing, it's maturing.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        This summit isn't about generic theory or recycled panels. It's built around the real challenges and opportunities facing DPC practices today, from clinical skill development to legal navigation, employer engagement, and sustainable growth. And Health Compiler is showing up with one clear goal: to help DPC clinics and networks unlock the power of data without the overwhelm.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-12 mb-4">Why We're Here: Making Data Make Sense for DPC</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-6">
        At Health Compiler, we believe data should be a driver, not a distraction. That's why we've built a platform designed specifically for Direct Primary Care environments. We take the friction out of analytics, so that busy clinics can get straight to insights that matter.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Whether you're a solo provider trying to demonstrate cost savings to an employer, a multi-location DPC group building a value story, or a coalition seeking standardized metrics across practices, we make it easier.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">Here's how:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Clear, employer-facing dashboards that translate clinical data into economic value</li>
        <li>Predictive insights that help you get ahead of patient trends and resource allocation</li>
        <li>AI voice agents that reduce front-desk burden by handling routine calls</li>
        <li>Clean, customizable reports that work for internal tracking, employer communication, and outcomes storytelling</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-12 mb-4">Why the DPC Summit 2025 Matters</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-6">
        This year's summit is packed with sessions tailored to the reality of running and scaling a DPC practice. Whether you're attending workshops on venipuncture and suturing, exploring the nuances of cashflow forecasting, learning to market your practice to employers, or unpacking MSO strategies, there's something for every stage of your DPC journey.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">You'll hear from experts on topics like:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Legal navigation for opt-out models</li>
        <li>Employer contracting and benefit design</li>
        <li>Incorporating lifestyle medicine into your practice</li>
        <li>Marketing, mindset, and sustainable nonprofit DPC models</li>
        <li>Data-driven strategies for financial health and hiring</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-6">
        In short, it's the most comprehensive DPC agenda to date, and it reflects the growing complexity and opportunity in this space. This is not just a primary care conference. It's where the DPC schedule meets serious business, clinical advancement, and systemic impact.
