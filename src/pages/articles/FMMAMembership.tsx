      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-12 mb-4">About FMMA</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-6">
        The free market movement (<a href="https://fmma.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary hover:underline">https://fmma.org/</a>) in healthcare is gaining steam. This is because of providers, patients, and self-funded employers, who believe that changing the way we purchase healthcare services is necessary, and seeking out value driven healthcare providers is important.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Matching a willing buyer with a willing seller of valuable healthcare services is the goal of everyone involved in this movement. We help identify patients willing to pay cash, doctors willing to list their prices, businesses attempting to provide affordable quality insurance, and providers/services/and patient advocates that are helping make everything work.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        To further promote this movement, the FMMA is dedicated to bringing together BUYERS and SELLERS.
