              Welcome to Health Compiler! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of Health Compiler Inc.'s ("Health Compiler", "we", or "us") offerings for direct care providers, including any related software or services (the "Service"), which are made available through our website, https://www.healthcompiler.com/, and any associated sites or mobile applications (collectively, the "Platform").

If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Service.
            </p>

            <p>
              By accepting these Terms through an online order document or executing an order form referencing these Terms (each an "Order Form"), you affirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms.

              For certain customers, these Terms may be part of another agreement, such as an enterprise master services agreement ("MSA"). In case of any conflict between these Terms and the MSA, the MSA will prevail.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Service is provided as software-as-a-service ("SaaS"), meaning it is accessed through the Platform and not installed locally on your devices. This ensures efficient delivery but requires uniform application of these Terms. For inquiries, please contact us at support@compile.health.

            <p>
              Please review these Terms carefully, as they may be updated periodically. We reserve the right to revise and update these Terms at our discretion. Material changes will be notified to you through the Platform or via the contact information you provided. Revised Terms will be effective thirty (30) days after such notice, unless a longer notice period is required by Applicable Law. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. If you reject the updated Terms within the notice period, the previous terms will remain in effect unless terminated according to their terms.

            </p>

            <p>
              The indemnification obligations outlined in Section 6.1(a) are contingent upon the indemnified party: (i) promptly notifying the indemnifying party in writing of the Claim; (ii) granting the indemnifying party sole control over the defense and settlement of the Claim (except that the indemnifying party may not settle or defend any Claim attributing culpability to the indemnified party without the indemnified party's prior written consent); and (iii) providing reasonable assistance to the indemnifying party, at the indemnifying party's expense. However, Health Compiler reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which case you agree to fully cooperate with Health Compiler in asserting any available defenses. You acknowledge that the provisions in this section will survive any termination of your Account, the Agreement, and/or your access to the Services.
            </p>

            <h3>6.2 Limitation of Liability.</h3>
            <p>

Additionally, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Company Parties shall not be held responsible for any damage, loss, or injury resulting from hacking, tampering, or other unauthorized access or use of the Services or your account or the information (including User Data) contained therein.

UNLESS BOTH YOU AND Health Compiler AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.

            <h3>8.3. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <p>
              Health Compiler is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by emailing customer support at support@compile.health. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to Health Compiler should be sent to 2261 Market Street #4632 San Francisco, CA 94114 ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Health Compiler and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Health Compiler may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Health Compiler or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Health Compiler is entitled.
            </p>

            <h3>8.4. Arbitration Procedures</h3>
            <p>
              Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's ("AAA") rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA's consumer arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms of Service and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
            </p>

            <p>
              Unless Health Compiler and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Health Compiler agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
            </p>

            <h3>8.5. Costs of Arbitration</h3>
            <p>
              Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the "Arbitration Fees") will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Health Compiler will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Health Compiler will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Health Compiler will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys' fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
            </p>

            <h3>8.6. Confidentiality</h3>
            <p>
              All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
            </p>

            <h3>8.7. Severability</h3>
            <p>
              If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) titled "Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief" above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled "Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief" are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of the Terms of Service will continue to apply.
            </p>

            <h3>8.8. Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement</h3>
            <p>
              Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Service to the contrary, Health Compiler agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Services, you may reject any such change by sending Health Compiler written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service).
