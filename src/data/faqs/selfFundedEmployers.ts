    question: 'What is Health Compiler for self-funded employers?',
    answer:
      'Health Compiler is a self-funded health plan analytics platform that provides employers with unified visibility into healthcare utilization, cost trends, benefits performance, and workforce health.\n\nThe platform consolidates data from TPAs, PBMs, stop-loss carriers, HRIS systems, DPC providers, and wearable platforms into a single analytics layer. This replaces fragmented vendor reports with structured, real-time intelligence that supports cost control and informed benefits strategy decisions.\n\nKey capabilities include:\n\n• PMPM trend analysis across medical, pharmacy, and specialty spend\n• High-cost claimant identification and early intervention signaling\n• Plan design performance comparisons\n• Vendor ROI measurement and accountability\n• Employer healthcare cost transparency dashboards\n\nHealth Compiler is an intelligence layer — not a TPA or benefits administrator. It enhances your existing ecosystem by making every data source visible and actionable in one platform.',

    question: 'How does Health Compiler reduce employer healthcare costs?',
    answer:
      'Health Compiler reduces employer healthcare costs by identifying utilization patterns, cost drivers, and avoidable high-cost events before they become budget emergencies.\n\nThe platform provides:\n\n• Emergency department usage trend analysis\n• Preventable admission identification\n• Chronic condition management gap detection\n• High-cost claimant early warning signals\n• DPC impact modeling and cost avoidance calculations\n• Pharmacy spend optimization insights\n\nInstead of waiting for end-of-year claims reports, employers see cost drivers as they emerge. This enables proactive cost containment strategies — such as targeted care management programs, plan design adjustments, or vendor changes — based on real data rather than actuarial estimates.\n\nHealth Compiler also supports scenario modeling, allowing employers to test the financial impact of benefits changes before committing. This shifts benefits strategy from reactive to proactive.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can Health Compiler measure Direct Primary Care ROI for employers?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Health Compiler measures DPC ROI by combining utilization analytics, cost modeling, and engagement metrics into structured employer-facing reports.\n\nThe platform provides:\n\n• Avoided claims estimations based on ER diversion and specialist avoidance\n• Utilization trend comparisons between DPC-enrolled and non-enrolled populations\n• Cost transparency dashboards showing DPC investment vs. total cost of care\n• Engagement metrics including visit frequency, preventive screening rates, and chronic care management participation\n• Employer-specific DPC ROI reporting for contract renewals\n\nThis supports data-driven DPC adoption decisions and helps employers justify their direct care investment to CFOs, boards, and plan participants.\n\nHealth Compiler uses actual employer claims and utilization data — not industry benchmarks — to build ROI models specific to each employer population.',

  {
    question: 'Does Health Compiler replace a TPA?',
    answer:
      'No. Health Compiler does not replace a TPA. It works alongside your existing TPA, PBM, stop-loss carrier, and other vendors as an analytics intelligence layer.\n\nTPAs handle claims adjudication, eligibility management, and plan administration. Health Compiler enhances TPA data by:\n\n• Normalizing claims feeds into structured analytics dashboards\n• Combining claims data with clinical, pharmacy, HRIS, and wearable data\n• Providing real-time cost and utilization visibility that TPA reports cannot deliver\n• Generating employer-facing dashboards and fiduciary-grade reports\n• Enabling vendor performance measurement across your entire benefits ecosystem\n\nHealth Compiler integrates with your TPA through structured claims feeds and secure APIs. You keep your existing vendors — you just finally get comprehensive visibility into whether they are performing.',

  {
    question: 'How does Health Compiler improve healthcare cost transparency for employers?',
    answer:
      'Health Compiler improves employer healthcare cost transparency by consolidating data across DPC, claims, pharmacy, clinical, and utilization feeds into structured dashboards that provide a complete view of plan performance.\n\nThis gives employers:\n\n• Clear cost visibility by category, provider network, and member cohort\n• Population-level insights into chronic disease burden and care utilization\n• Predictive trend analysis for PMPM cost trajectories\n• Benchmark comparisons against peer organizations and industry standards\n• Vendor-level spend analysis with ROI measurement\n\nMost self-funded employers receive fragmented reports from multiple vendors on different timelines using different methodologies.

    answer:
      'Health Compiler ingests data from multiple vendors — including TPAs, PBMs, stop-loss carriers, HRIS systems, DPC platforms, and wearable devices — and normalizes everything into a unified member record.\n\nThe data integration process:\n\n• Accepts standard file feeds and API connections from each vendor\n• Deduplicates member records across data sources\n• Normalizes coding standards and data formats\n• Maps all data points to a single unified member profile\n• Updates in real time as new data arrives\n\nThis solves the fundamental problem with employer healthcare analytics: when six different vendors each define a "member" differently and report on different timelines, the analytics built on top are unreliable.\n\nHealth Compiler creates one version of the truth. When you see a number in the platform, you can trust it — and when you share it with your CFO, broker, or board, they can trust it too.',
