    question: 'What problem does Health Compiler solve?',
    answer:
      'Health Compiler solves healthcare data fragmentation — the systemic challenge that prevents employers, providers, ACOs, and health plans from making evidence-based decisions about healthcare cost and quality.\n\nToday, healthcare data is scattered across TPAs, PBMs, EHRs, HRIS systems, DPC platforms, and wearable devices. Each system uses different data formats, member identifiers, and reporting timelines. The result: no single stakeholder has a complete, real-time view of healthcare performance.\n\nHealth Compiler addresses this by:\n\n• Ingesting data from all major healthcare data sources\n• Normalizing and deduplicating data into unified member records\n• Providing real-time analytics dashboards across cost, quality, and utilization\n• Enabling AI-powered insights including predictive modeling and anomaly detection\n• Supporting multiple stakeholder views from a single data platform\n\nThis is infrastructure — not a point solution. Health Compiler is the analytics layer that the fragmented healthcare ecosystem has been missing.',

    question: 'What makes Health Compiler defensible?',
    answer:
      'Health Compiler\'s defensibility is built on five structural advantages that compound over time:\n\n• Infrastructure-first architecture: Health Compiler operates as the data layer beneath healthcare analytics, not as a point solution. This creates deep integration with customer operations that makes switching costly.\n\n• Multi-sided integration model: The platform connects DPC practices, employers, ACOs, health plans, and health systems. Each new participant adds data and context that makes the platform more valuable for all users.\n\n• AI-enabled analytics engine: The Infera engine powers risk stratification, anomaly detection, predictive modeling, and natural language reporting. AI capabilities improve with data scale.\n\n• Compliance-first design: HIPAA compliant infrastructure, audit trails, and fiduciary-grade reporting are built into the platform architecture — not bolted on. This creates trust barriers for competitors.\n\n• Data network effects: As more entities connect to Health Compiler, the benchmarking, risk modeling, and predictive capabilities become more accurate and comprehensive.',
