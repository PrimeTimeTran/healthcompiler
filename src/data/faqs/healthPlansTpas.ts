    question: 'How does Health Compiler integrate with TPAs?',
    answer:
      'Health Compiler integrates with third-party administrators using structured claims feeds, eligibility files, and secure APIs.\n\nThe integration process:\n\n• Accepts standard claims file formats (EDI 837/835, CSV) from TPA systems\n• Ingests eligibility and enrollment data for member matching\n• Normalizes claims data across different TPA platforms and coding standards\n• Maps all data to unified member records\n• Updates dashboards in real time as new claims data arrives\n\nHealth Compiler enhances TPA data by combining it with clinical, pharmacy, HRIS, DPC, and wearable data sources that TPAs do not typically access. This creates a comprehensive analytics view that goes beyond what standard TPA reporting can deliver.\n\nThe platform is designed to work alongside TPAs — not replace them. TPAs continue to handle claims adjudication and plan administration while Health Compiler provides the intelligence layer.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can Health Compiler unify DPC and claims data for health plans?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Health Compiler unifies Direct Primary Care membership and utilization data with traditional claims feeds from TPAs and PBMs into a single analytics platform.\n\nThis creates a comprehensive view of:\n\n• Total cost of care across both DPC and insurance-based services\n• Utilization trends comparing DPC-enrolled vs. non-enrolled populations\n• Care engagement metrics across both delivery models\n• Cost driver identification spanning all care channels\n• Population health trends across the entire membership\n\nFor health plans and TPAs supporting employer clients that offer DPC as a benefits option, this unified view is essential. It eliminates the data silos that prevent stakeholders from understanding the full impact of DPC on plan performance.\n\nHealth Compiler normalizes data from different sources into a common structure, ensuring accurate comparisons and actionable reporting.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does Health Compiler replace existing health plan analytics systems?',
    answer:
